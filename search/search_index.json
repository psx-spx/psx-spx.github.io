The wiring and layout of the ROMs varies across boards; on some systems the BIOS, game binary and its assets are part of the same ROM region, while others split them into separate areas. Boards with custom sound hardware usually store samples and other audio data in dedicated ROMs accessed directly by the hardware in question.</p> <p>Konami systems store game executables and assets on standard SCSI/IDE hard drives or CD-ROMs. The System 573 can also boot from its built-in flash or a PCMCIA flash card, using the CD-ROM drive only to install new games, however the vast majority of 573 games are too large to fit entirely in the flash and still rely on reading files from the disc after installation. The Twinkle System is particularly unusual as it has a CD-ROM drive accessed by the main CPU, a separate hard drive used by the audio board and an external DVD player unit for background videos.</p> <p>The System 12, System 10 and the ZN-1 with the Bust-A-Move 2 ROM board are the only currently known non-Konami PCBs with CD-ROM support. The former requires an expansion module that provides an IDE interface and XA-ADPCM decoding through an integrated SH-2 CPU, while the latter two can be connected directly to a drive. In all cases the CD-ROM is only used for audio streaming and the boards are not otherwise capable of booting directly from it without a ROM board installed.</p>"},{"location":"arcadecabinets/#security","title":"Security","text":"<p>The implementation of anti-piracy measures varies for each manufacturer.</p> <ul> <li>Namco's System 11 and 12 employ a CPLD or ASIC (\"KEYCUS\" chip) on each ROM   module as a game-specific security coprocessor the CPU communicates with. In   the case of the System 12, the KEYCUS chip seems to double as a lockout device   and restrict access to the ROMs until the game issues an unlocking sequence.</li> <li>Namco System 10 games also use a KEYCUS CPLD but wire it between the CPU and   ROMs, allowing it to perform on-the-fly unscrambling of their encrypted   contents in addition to the lockout functionality.</li> <li>Similarly, most Taito G-NET games are stored on non-standard PCMCIA flash   cards that require unlock sequences specific to each game prior to being   accessed.</li> <li>Sony's ZN-1 and ZN-2 are fitted by each manufacturer with a custom BIOS ROM   and security/decryption ASIC, which the game-specific ROM daughterboard then   relies on.

Alternately, you can wait for an IRQ (which seems to take place MUCH later), and then read the response. If there are any pending cdrom interrupts from a previous command, for example, an INT3/Acknowledge, these should be cleared before sending a new command. If a new  command is sent early anyway, the behavior becomes unpredictable. For one, BUSYSTS  will stay set from the last command. In addition to this, the new command will simplily sit in the command register unhandled and can be easily overwritten by new commands that are sent.

The memfill region is zerofilled by a \"relative\" fast word-by-word fill (so address and size must be multiples of 4) (despite of the word-by-word filling, still it's SLOW because the memfill executes in uncached slow ROM). The reserved region at [038h-04Bh] is internally used by the BIOS to memorize the caller's RA,SP,R30,R28,R16 registers (for some bizarre reason, this information is saved in the exe header, rather than on the caller's stack). Additionally to the initial PC,R28,SP,R30 values that are contained in the header, two parameter values are passed to the executable (in R4 and R5 registers) (however, usually that values are simply R4=1 and R5=0). Like normal functions, the executable can return control to the caller by jumping to the incoming RA address (provided that it hasn't destroyed the stack or other important memory locations, and that it has pushed/popped all registers) (returning works only for non-boot executables; if the boot executable returns to the BIOS, then the BIOS will simply lockup itself by calling the \"SystemErrorBootOrDiskFailure\" function.</p>"},{"location":"cdromfileformats/#relocatable-exe","title":"Relocatable EXE","text":"<p>Fade to Black (CINE.EXR) contains ID \"PS-X EXR\" (instead \"PS-X EXE\") and string \"PSX Relocable File - Delphine Software Int.\", this is supposedly some custom relocatable exe file (unsupported by the PSX kernel).</p>"},{"location":"cdromfileformats/#msdosexe-and-windowsexe-files","title":"MSDOS.EXE and WINDOWS.EXE Files","text":"<p>Some PSX discs contain DOS or Windows .EXE files (with \"MZ\" headers), eg. devkit leftovers, or demos/gimmicks.</p>"},{"location":"cdromfileformats/#cdrom-file-psyq-cpe-files-debug-executables","title":"CDROM File PsyQ .CPE Files (Debug Executables)","text":""},{"location":"cdromfileformats/#fileheader","title":"Fileheader","text":"<pre><code>  00h 4   File ID (01455043h aka \"CPE\",01h)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"cdromfileformats/#chunk-00h-end-of-file","title":"Chunk 00h: End of File","text":"<pre><code>  00h 1   Chunk ID (00h)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"cdromfileformats/#chunk-01h-load-data","title":"Chunk 01h: Load Data","text":"<p><pre><code>  00h 1   Chunk ID (01h)\n  01h 4   Address (usually 80010000h and up)\n  05h 4   Size (LEN)\n  09h LEN Data (binary EXE code/data)\n</code></pre> Theoretically, this could contain the whole EXE body in a single chunk.

And that the alignment space is zeropadded (in case of R-Types, only the header is 00h-padded, but files are FFh-padded). The detection could go wrong, especially if the archive contains very few files, some of the nested DOT1's contain only one file (header \"00000001h, 00000008h\", without any further increasing offsets or padding).

Files with ext.hdr have N&gt;1, Flags=1 (but files\n without ext.hdr can also have those settings). Files with ext.hdr do usually\n have uncommon garbage values at hdr[4], which isn't too helpful for detection.\n The only way to detect models with ext.hdr seems to be to check if the ext.hdr\n contains valid increasing entries in range 0..N-1.\n WAD's that do contain a model with ext.hdr do usually also contain an extra\n 100h-byte file, that file contains N bytes for model 0..N-1 (plus zeropadding\n to 100h-byte size), the bytes are supposedly redirecting models without Data\n Arrays to some other data source.\n The 100h-byte files don't have any header or checksum, they contain up to 9Ch\n entries (so there's always some zeropadding to 100h), the existing 100h-byte\n files contain following values in first 4 bytes (as 32bit value):\n  04141401h, 0C040017h, 01010101h, 09030503h, 0A0B0A0Bh, 03020102h, 0C060900h,\n  00060501h, 04040201h, 01010203h, 01030201h, 05000302h, 0C040317h, or Zero.\n  To distinguish from other files: BIN/MAP files start with a 4-byte aligned\n  Size value; if Size=0 or (Size AND 3)&gt;0 or Size&gt;RemainingSize then it's\n  probably a 100h-byte file. Best also check if last some bytes are zeropadded.\n Exceptions:\n  Retail MP090..MP100_*.WAD has model with ext.hdr, but no 100h-byte file\n  Demo MP041_00.WAD has model with ext.hdr, with zerofilled 100h-byte file\n Note: Some models have ALL models listed in ext.hdr (which is about same as\n not having any ext.hdr at all; except, they ARE bundled with 100h-byte file).\n</code></pre> CROCFILE.DIR\\MP*.DEM <pre><code> Some (not all) MP*.WAD files are bundled with MP*.DEM files, supposedly\n containing data for demonstration mode.

Zoo is from 1986-1991, long filenames were supported only for OSes that did support them at that time (ie. not for DOS/Windows). When adding new files, Zoo defaults to maintain backups of old files in the archive (older files are marked as \"deleted\" via [01Eh]=1, but are kept in the archive; until the user issues command \"P\" for repacking/removing deleted files) (Zoo 2.xx can additionally use a \"generation\" limit of 0..15, which means to keep 0..15 older copies).

The 16 bytes per sector are: <pre><code>  Q0..Q9   Subchannel Q data (normally position data)\n  Q10..Q11 Subchannel Q checksum\n  Q12..Q15 Dummy/garbage/padding (usually 00000000h or FFFFFFFFh)\n</code></pre> Unfortunately, there are at least 3 variants of the format: <pre><code>  1.

Without anything (only Q0 intact, but Q1..Q15 zerofilled)\n</code></pre> The third variant is definetly corrupt (and one should ignore such zerofilled entries). The second variant is corrupt, too (but one might attempt to repair them by guessing the missing checksum: if it contains normal position values assume correct crc, if it contains uncommon values assume a libcrypted sector with bad crc). The M3S format is intended for libcrypted PSX games, but, people seem to have also recorded (corrupted) M3S files for unprotected PSX games (in so far, more than often, the M3S files might cause problems, instead of solving them). Note: The odd 16-byte format with 4-byte padding does somehow resemble the \"P and Q Sub-Channel\" format 'defined' in MMC-drafts; if the .M3S format was based on the MMC stuff: then the 16th byte might contain a Subchannel P \"pause\" flag in bit7.</p>"},{"location":"cdromfileformats/#cdrom-images-with-subchannel-data","title":"CDROM Images with Subchannel Data","text":"<p>Most CDROM-Image formats can (optionally) contain subchannel recordings.

The (de-)scrambling is done automatically by the CDROM controller, so disc images should usually contain unscrambled data (there are some exceptions such like CD-i discs that have audio and data sectors mixed inside of the same track; which may confuse the CDROM controller about whether or not to apply scrambling to which sectors; so one may need to manually XOR the faulty sectors in the disc image).

Probably, the hardware does actually do the above stuff in two steps: first, applying a zig-zag filter (with only around 21-points) to the 37800Hz output, and then doing 44100Hz interpolation (2-point linear or 4-point gaussian or whatever) in a second step. That two-step theory would also match well for 18900Hz resampling (which has lower-pitch zigzag, and gets spread across about fifty 44100Hz samples).</p>"},{"location":"cdromformat/#xa-adpcm-emphasis","title":"XA-ADPCM Emphasis","text":"<p>With XA-Emphasis enabled in Sub-header, output will appear as so: <pre><code>           .------------.                           ....-----.\n           |            |                        .''         |\n           |    Raw     |                       .'

Accordingly there's no Motorola Bootstrap mode in it, but of course one can simply dump the EPROM with standard eprom utilities, as done by TriMesh).</p>"},{"location":"cdrominternalinfoonpsxcdromcontroller/#cdrom-internal-cxd1815q-sub-cpu-configuration-registers","title":"CDROM Internal CXD1815Q Sub-CPU Configuration Registers","text":""},{"location":"cdrominternalinfoonpsxcdromcontroller/#00h-drvif-drive-interface-w","title":"00h - DRVIF - Drive Interface (W)","text":"<pre><code>  0-1 \"L\"     Reserved (should be 0)\n  2   LSB 1st CD DSP DATA order               (0=MSB first, 1=LSB first)\n  3-4 BCK MD  CD DSP Number of BCLKs per WCLK (0=16, 1=24, 2=32, 3=Reserved)\n  5   BCK RED Strobe DATA on BLCK Edge        (0=Falling Edge, 1=Rising Edge)\n  6   LCH LOW Channel on LRCK=Low             (0=Right, 1=Left)\n  7   C2PL1st      ...

All bytes with Flag=0 are ORed together to compute a Dummy byte. If the Character byte is same as the Dummy byte, then it gets destroyed by setting Character=00h (to avoid that, one could set all dummies to 00h, or set one or more dummies to FFh, for example). Finally, \"xy\" bit0=0 indicates that the resulting character byte is inverted (XORed by FFh), however, the CDROM BIOS does always use bit0=1, so the inversion feature is never used. For the whole SCEx string, there must be at least one 00h byte inserted between each character (or some Char=Dummy mismatch, which results in Char=00h either), and there should be a few more 00h bytes preceeding the first character (\"S\"). Note: Modchips didn't bother to reproduce that new SCEx transfers, instead they have simply bypassed it by injecting the 250 baud SCEx string to some analog lower level signal.</p>"},{"location":"cdrominternalinfoonpsxcdromcontroller/#cxd2938q-cx3bxxxx-some-changed-bits","title":"CXD2938Q - CX(3Bxxxx) - Some Changed Bits","text":"<p>Same as in older version, but initialized slightly differently: CXD2545Q used CX(3B2250) whilst CXD2938Q is using CX(3B7250).</p>"},{"location":"cdrominternalinfoonpsxcdromcontroller/#cxd2938q-cx3cxxxx-tzccoutselect-with-newchanged-extra-bits","title":"CXD2938Q - CX(3Cxxxx) - TzcCoutSelect with New/Changed Extra Bits","text":"<p>The CXD2545Q used two 8bit commands, CX(3C) and CX(3D), for TzcOut selection, which are now replaced by a single 24bit command, CX(3Cxxxx), and which do include a new mode related to New SCEx. <pre><code>  CXD2545Q   CXD2938Q\n  CX(3C)     CX(3C0080) TzcCoutSelectHPTZC;\\ &lt;--formerly CX(3C)\n  -          CX(3C2080) TzcCoutSelectSCEX ;  &lt;--special NewScex mode\n  CX(3D)     CX(3C4080) TzcCoutSelectDTZC ;/ &lt;--formerly CX(3D)\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"cdrominternalinfoonpsxcdromcontroller/#cxd2938q-cx8xxxxx-disc-mode-with-newchanged-extra-bits","title":"CXD2938Q - CX(8xxxxx) - Disc Mode with New/Changed Extra Bits","text":"<p>Command CX(8xx) has been 12bit wide on CXD2545Q, and is now expanded 24bit width (with some changed/unknown bits). <pre><code>  CXD2545Q   CXD2938Q\n  CX(8180)   CX(810408) MODE = Audio (CD-DA)\n  CX(8120)   CX(812400) MODE = Audio (CD-DA) (manual SPI bus access)\n  CX(8980)   CX(890408) MODE = CDROM (Data)\n  -          CX(898000) MODE = CDROM (Data) (used on RESET)\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"cdrominternalinfoonpsxcdromcontroller/#cxd2938q-cx9xx000-normaldouble-speed-with-new-extra-bits","title":"CXD2938Q - CX(9xx000) - Normal/Double Speed with New Extra Bits","text":"<p>Command CX(9xx) has been 12bit wide on CXD2545Q (with bit12=reserved/zero), and is now expanded 24bit width (with bit12=unknown/one and bit11-0=unknown/zero).</p>"},{"location":"cdrominternalinfoonpsxcdromcontroller/#cxd2938q-cxdx0000-and-cxex0000-new-zero-padding","title":"CXD2938Q - CX(Dx0000) and CX(Ex0000) - New Zero Padding","text":"<p>Commands CX(Dx) and CX(Ex) have been 8bit wide on CXD2545Q, and are now zeropadded to 24bit width, ie.

On a Compact Disc, the term \"Track\" does normally refer to Audio tracks (songs). But the drive hardware uses the terms \"Track\" and \"Tracking\" for different purposes: Tracking appears to refer to moving the Optics via magnets (ie. moving only the laser/lens, without actually moving the whole sled) (this is done for fine adjustments, and it seems to happen more or less automatically; emulators can just return increasing sectors without needing to handle special tracking commands). Track jumps refer to moving the entire Sled, one \"track\" is equal to one spiral winding (1.6 micrometers). One winding contains between 9 sectors on innermost windings, and 22.5 sectors on outermost windings (the PSX cdrom bios is translating the sector-distance to non-linear track-distance, and emulators must undo that translation; otherwise the sled doesn't arrive at the intended location; the cdrom bios will retry seeking a couple of times and eventually settle down at the desired location - but it will timeout if the sled emulation is too inaccurate). The PSX hardware uses two mechanisms for moving the Sled: Command CX(4xxx) Forward/Reverse Track Jump: allows to move the sled by 1..131070 tracks (ie. max 210 millimeters), and the hardware does stop automatically after reaching the desired distance. Command CX(2x) Forward/Reverse Fast Sled: moves the sled continously until it gets stopped by another command (in this mode, software can watch the COUT signal, which gets toggled each \"N\" tracks; whereas \"N\" can be selected via Command CX(Bxxxx), which is configured to N=100h in PSX). The PSX cdrom bios is issuing another Fast Sled command (in opposite direction) after Fast Sled commands, emulators must somehow interprete this as \"sled slowdown\" (rather than as actually moving the sled in opposite direction, which could move the sled miles away from the target). For some reason vC1 BIOS is using a relative short slowdown period, whilst vC2/vC3 are using much longer slowdown periods (probably related to different SledKickHeight aka SledKickLevel settings and/or to different Sled Move Voltage settings).</p>"},{"location":"cdrominternalinfoonpsxcdromcontroller/#focus-gain-balance","title":"Focus / Gain / Balance","text":"<p>The hardware includes commands for adjusting &amp; measuring focus/gain/balance.

CDI_ALL.RTF and CDI_BUM.RTF cannot be read/copied under Windows 7 (which is weirdly reporting them to use an \"invalid MS-DOS function\"; some people also reported having CDI_IMAG.RTF files with similar problems).

Unfortunately, the value FFFh can also occur anywhere in the audio data (eg. a 16bit sample with value 3FFCh).

The best method is to compute the frame size (based on the supposed frame header), and then to check if supposed frame begins AND ends with a sync word. Moreover, one could check for invalid sample rate values in the frame header, or invalid \"groupings\" in the frame's data part. VCDs are conventionally having three audio frames encoded in one CDROM sector, so the first syncword can be simply found right after the multiplex packet header (though that might differ in some cases: VCD2.0 allows different audio bitrates, and a CDROM sector could be theoretically shared for Audio and Video data).</p>"},{"location":"cdromvideocdsvcd/#overall-mp2-frame-format","title":"Overall MP2 Frame Format","text":"<pre><code>  Header (32bit)\n  Optional CRC (16bit) (or 0bit if none)\n  Allocation Information\n  Scale Factor Selector Information\n  Scale Factors\n  Data\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"cdromvideocdsvcd/#mp2-header","title":"MP2 Header","text":"<pre><code>  12bit Syncword (FFFh)                                         ;\\\n  1bit  Revision (0=MPEG-2, 1=MPEG-1)                           ; 2 bytes\n  2bit  Layer (2=Audio LayerII)                   ;for VCDs     ;\n              (3=LayerI, 1=LayerIII, 0=reserved)  ;not on VCDs  ;\n  1bit  Protection_bit (1=no crc)                               ;/\n  4bit  Bitrate_index (1..14)                                   ;\\\n          (0=free format, 15=reserved)                          ;\n  2bit  Sampling_frequency                                      ; 1 byte\n  1bit  Padding_bit                                             ;\n  1bit  Private_bit                                             ;/\n  2bit  Mode                                                    ;\\\n  2bit  Mode_extension (aka bound)                              ;\n  1bit  Copyright                                               ; 1 byte\n  1bit  Original/home                                           ;\n  2bit  Emphasis                                                ;/\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"cdromvideocdsvcd/#mp2-checksum-optional","title":"MP2 Checksum (optional)","text":"<pre><code>  16bit CRC\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"cdromvideocdsvcd/#allocation-information","title":"Allocation Information","text":""},{"location":"cdromvideocdsvcd/#scale-factor-selector-information","title":"Scale Factor Selector Information","text":""},{"location":"cdromvideocdsvcd/#scale-factors","title":"Scale Factors","text":""},{"location":"cdromvideocdsvcd/#data","title":"Data","text":"<pre><code>  XXX...\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"cheatdevices/","title":"Cheat Devices","text":""},{"location":"cheatdevices/#action-replay-gameshark-gamebuster-goldfinger-equalizer-datelclones","title":"Action Replay, GameShark, Gamebuster, GoldFinger, Equalizer (Datel/clones)","text":"<p>The Datel devices exist in various official/cloned hardware revisions, the DB25 connector requires a special Comms Link ISA card (or a \"FiveWire\" mod for making it compatible with normal PC parallel ports).

Both of the above is working (one needs only the Slot A+B+C+D part, and it doesn't matter if the other part is Slot A, or Garbage; as long as the software is able/aware of ignoring the Garbage). Garbage response means that the multitap returns ONLY four bytes, like so: Hiz,80h,5Ah,LSB (ie. the leading HighZ byte, the 5A80h Multitap ID, and the LSB of the Slot A controller ID), and aborts transfer after that four bytes.</p>"},{"location":"controllersandmemorycards/#multitap-memory-card-access","title":"Multitap Memory Card Access","text":"<p>Normally memory card access is done by sending this bytes to the card: <pre><code>  80 xx .. ..      ;normal access\n</code></pre> And with the multitap, memory cards can be accessed as so: <pre><code>  8n xx .. ..      ;access memory card in slot \"n\" (1..4)\n</code></pre> That's the way how its done in Silent Hill.

Instead, the lightgun signal triggers IRQ10, and the interrupt handler is intended to \"latch\" the coordinates by software (by reading Timer 0 and 1 values, which must configured to be synchronized with the GPU). That method requires IRQ handling to be properly implemented in software (basically, IRQs should not be disabled for longer periods, and DMA transfers should not block the bus for longer periods). In practice, most programmers probably don't realize how to do that, to the worst, Sony seems to have delivered a slightly bugged library (libgun) to developers.

The libgun stuff assigns an even higher priority by patching the BIOS exception handler, causing IRQ10 to be processed shortly before processing the priority chains (the resulting IRQ priority isn't actually higher as when using 1st element of chain 0; the main difference is that it skips some time consuming code which pushes registers R4..R30). For details on that patch, see: BIOS Patches Even if IRQ10 has highest priority, execution of (older) other IRQs may cause a new IRQ10 to be executed delayed (because IRQs are disabled during IRQ handling), to avoid that problem: Best don't enable any other IRQs except IRQ0 and IRQ10, or, if you need other IRQs, best have them enabled only during Vblank (there are no scanlines drawn during vblank, so IRQ10 should never trigger during that period).

However, IRQ10 does also get triggered in the next some scanlines, so the first IRQ10 is used only as a notification that the CPU should watch out for further IRQ10's. Ie. the IRQ10 handler should disable all DMAs, acknowledge IRQ10, and then enter a waitloop that waits for the IRQ10 bit in I_STAT to become set again (or abort if a timeout occurs) and then read the timers, reportedly like so: <pre><code>  IF NTSC then X=(Timer0-140)*0.198166, Y=Timer1\n  IF PAL  then X=(Timer0-140)*0.196358, Y=Timer1\n</code></pre> No idea why PAL/NTSC should use different factors, that factors are looking quite silly/bugged, theoretically, the pixel-to-clock ratio should be the exactly same for PAL and NTSC...? Mind that reading Timer values in Dotclock/Hblank mode is unstable, for Timer1 this can be fixed by the read-retry method, for Timer0 this could be done too, but one would need to subtract the retry-time to get a correct coordinate; alternately Timer0 can run at system clock (which doesn't require read-retry), but it must be then converted to video clock (mul 11, div 7), and then from video clock to dot clock (eg. div 8 for 320-pixel mode). Above can be repeated for the next some scanlines (allowing to take the medium values as result, and/or to eliminate faulty values which are much bigger or smaller than the other values).

The DTL-H2000 BIOS accesses 1F802030h with 8bit load/store opcodes, however, the Lightgun games use 32bit load/store - which is theoretically overlapping port 1F802032h, though maybe the memory system does ignore the upper bits.</p>"},{"location":"expansionportpio/#1f802032h-dtl-h2000-exp2-maybe-irq-enable","title":"1F802032h - DTL-H2000: EXP2:  - maybe IRQ enable?","text":"<pre><code>  0    Used for something (CLEARED on some occassions)\n  1-3  Unknown/unused\n  4    Used for something (SET on some occassions)\n  5-7  Unknown/unused\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"expansionportpio/#1f802040h-dtl-h2000-exp2-1-byte-dip-switch","title":"1F802040h - DTL-H2000: EXP2: 1-byte - DIP Switch?","text":"<p><pre><code>  0-7  DIP Value (00h..FFh, but should be usually 00h..02h)\n</code></pre> This register selects the DTL-H2000 boot mode, for whatever reason it's called \"DIP Switch\" register, although the DTL-H2000 boards don't seem to contain any such DIP Switches (instead, it's probably configured via some I/O ports on PC side).

However, this garbage is actually important for bugged games like R-Types and Fade to Black (ie. games that do read from address 00000000h due to using uninitialized pointers). Initially, the garbage area is containing a copy of the 16-byte exception handler at address 80h, but the first 4-bytes are typically smashed (set to 00000003h from some useless dummy writes in some useless CDROM delays). Ie. the 16-bytes should have these values: <pre><code>  [00000000h]=3C1A0000h  ;&lt;-- but overwritten by 00000003h after soon\n  [00000004h]=275A0C80h  ;&lt;-- or 275A0C50h (in older BIOS)\n  [00000008h]=03400008h\n  [0000000Ch]=00000000h\n</code></pre> For R-Types, the halfword at [0] must non-zero (else the game will do a DMA to address 0, and thereby destroy kernel memory).

BIOS Functions (and custom callback functions) are allowed to destroy registers R1-R15, R24-R25, R31 (RA), and HI/LO. Registers R16-R23, R29 (SP), and R30 (FP) must be left unchanged (if the function uses that registers, then it must push/pop them). R26 (K0) is reserved for exception handler and should be usually not used by other functions. R27 (K1) and R28 (GP) are left more or less unused by the BIOS, so one can more or less freely use them for whatever purpose.

That, not so much because the hardware would be slow, but rather because of improper inefficent code at the BIOS side. The original BIOS tries to synchronize memory card accesses with joypad accesses simply by accessing only one sector per frame (although it could access circa two sectors). To the worst, the BIOS accesses Slot 1 only on each second frame, and Slot 2 only each other frame (although in 99% of all cases only one slot is accessed at once, so the access time drops to 0.5 sectors per frame). Moreover, the memory card id, directory, and broken sector list do occupy 26 sectors (although the whole information would fit into 4 or 5 sectors) (a workaround would be to read only the first some bytes, and to skip the additional unused bytes - though that'd also mean to skip the checksums which are unfortunately stored at the end of the sector).

Synchronous means that the BIOS function doesn't return until the access has completed (which means, due to the poor performance, that the function spends about 75% of the time on inactivity) (except in nocash PSX bios, which has better performance), whilst asynchronous access means that the BIOS function returns immediately after invoking the access (which does then continue on interrupt level, and does return an event when finished). The file \"read\" and \"write\" functions act asynchronous when accessmode bit15 is set when opening the file. Additionally, the A(ACh) _card_load(port) function can be used to tell the BIOS to load the directory entries and broken sector list to its internal RAM buffers (eg. during the games title screen, so the BIOS doesn't need to load that data once when the game enters its memory card menu). All other functions like erase or format always act synchronous. The open/findfirst/findnext functions do normally complete immediately without accessing the card at all (unless the directory wasn't yet read; in that case the directory is loading in synchronous fashion). Unfortunately, the asynchronous response doesn't rely on a single callback event, but rather on a bunch of different events which must be all allocated and tested by the game (and of which, one event is delivered on completion) (which one depends on whether function completed okay, or if an error occurred).</p>"},{"location":"kernelbios/#multitap-support-and-multitap-problems","title":"Multitap Support (and Multitap Problems)","text":"<p>The BIOS does have some partial support for accessing more than two memory cards (via Multitap adaptors).

The original BIOS is so inefficient that it takes hundreds of clock cycles between the interrupt request and the IRQ acknowledge, so, normally, it doesn't require an additional delay. However, the central mistake in the IRQ handler is that it doesn't memorize which IRQ has originally triggered the interrupt. For example, it may get triggered by a timer IRQ, but a newer card IRQ may occur during IRQ handling, in that case, the card IRQ may get processed and acknowledged without the required delay.

Problems are that the hardcoded addresses won't work with all BIOSes (eg. not with the no$psx bios clone, probably also not with the newer PS2 BIOS), moreover, the checksumming can fail with patched original BIOSes (eg. no$psx allows to enable TTY debug messages and to skip the BIOS intro).

Only one of them is   populated; it presumably sets or clears a bit in one of the ASIC input ports.   Given the labels it may be related to the manufacturer of the onboard flash   memory (Fujitsu or Sharp), however even boards fitted with Sharp chips come   with the <code>FJ</code> resistor populated. Moreover, all known games identify the chips   by probing their JEDEC ID.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"konamisystem573/#differences-vs-ps1","title":"Differences vs. PS1","text":""},{"location":"konamisystem573/#main-changes","title":"Main changes","text":"<ul> <li>Main RAM is 4 MB instead of 2 MB and VRAM is 2 MB instead of 1 MB. SPU   RAM is still 512 KB.</li> <li>The CD-ROM drive is completely different. While the PS1's drive is fully   integrated into the motherboard and uses a custom protocol, the 573 employs a   standard ATAPI drive. It can thus boot from burned CD-Rs or even CD-RWs just   fine (as long as the drive itself is capable of reading them in the first   place), with no modifications needed to the stock hardware. There is no   provision for playing XA-ADPCM, however CD-DA playback through the drive's own   audio output (fed into the 573 motherboard via a 4-pin audio cable) is   supported and used by some games.</li> <li>The SIO0 bus for controllers and memory cards is unused. It is broken out   to a connector, however no known I/O board uses it. Some games supported PS1   controllers and memory cards through an adapter connected over JVS (see the   external modules section).</li> <li>The \"parallel I/O\" expansion port is replaced by 2 PCMCIA slots. These   slots are wired in parallel and mapped at the same address as the internal   flash through bank switching. They are fairly limited though as they only   support 16-bit bus accesses (i.e. <code>/CE1</code> and <code>/CE2</code> are tied together, even   though the CPU actually exposes them as separate signals!), have no DMA and   don't expose the PCMCIA I/O and configuration space (<code>/IORD</code> and <code>/IOWR</code> are   not connected at all). This makes them incompatible with CF cards and most   PCMCIA devices.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"konamisystem573/#additional-hardware","title":"Additional hardware","text":"<ul> <li>Audio and video outputs: unlike the PS1, which outputs composite, S-video   and RGB, the 573 only outputs RGB with C-sync through the JAMMA connector and   a DB15 port compliant with the JVS specification (same pinout as VGA but not   directly compatible, as VGA normally runs at higher resolutions and uses   separate H/V sync pins). A built-in 15 watt stereo speaker amplifier is also   provided for cabinets that lack their own sound system.</li> <li>JAMMA interface and built-in I/O ports: the 573 provides multiple digital   and analog ports for interfacing with arcade cabinet controls. Depending on   the I/O board the system came with, these signals might be broken out through   connectors on the system's case.</li> <li>Internal 16 MB flash memory: the 573's BIOS is capable of booting either   from the CD drive or from an array of flash memory chips soldered to the   motherboard, which are also memory mapped. Most Konami games are designed to   run from flash: when attempting to run them from CD without also having them   installed, the executable on the disc will erase the flash and install the   game before starting. Most games still require the CD, in some cases a   different one, to be kept in the drive after installation as they use it for   music playback or to stream additional data.</li> <li>PCMCIA memory card: some games shipped with additional flash memory in the   form of one or more 16 or 32 MB PCMCIA cards. Note that these are \"linear\"   memory mapped flash cards without any built-in controller, not CF or   ATA-compatible cards. See the BIOS section for more details on why CF cards   are not supported.</li> <li>RTC and battery-backed 8 KB RAM: used by games to store settings, save   data and installation info (possibly including serial numbers). Unfortunately   the RTC chip is one of those all-in-one things with a battery sealed inside,   soldered directly to the motherboard.</li> <li>JVS host: allows connection of multiple daisy chained peripherals using   the standardized JVS protocol, based on a serial (RS-485) bus. The JVS port on   the 573 was only ever \"officially\" used for the PS1 memory card reader module,   however some games seem to support JVS I/O boards and input devices in   addition to the built-in JAMMA connector.</li> <li>Security cartridge: optionally installed on the 573's side, contains a   password protected EEPROM that holds factory pre-programmed data as well as   keys generated during game installation, plus in some case a 64-bit serial   number ROM. Security cartridges were bundled with most game discs as a way to   prevent copying, as the discs themselves had no other protection of any kind.

Unlike the PS1, however, the 573 ignores <code>SYSTEM.CNF</code> completely regardless of whether or not it is present on the disc; the shell is hardcoded to always load <code>PSX.EXE</code>. Homebrew discs can take advantage of this behavior to provide separate PS1 and 573 executables instead of detecting the system type at runtime.</p> <p>If DIP switch 4 is on, the shell expects to find a standard PS1 executable (including the full 2048-byte header) at offset <code>0x24</code> on either the built-in flash memory or one of the two PCMCIA flash cards, preceded by a CRC32 checksum of it at offset <code>0x20</code>. The CRC is stored in little endian format and is not calculated on the whole executable, but rather only on bytes whose offsets are a power of two (i.e. on bytes at <code>0x24 + 0</code>, <code>0x24 + 1</code>, <code>0x24 + 2</code>, <code>0x24 + 4</code> and so on).

XA is not supported by any ATAPI drive. CD-DA is   supported by both the PS1 CD drive and ATAPI drives, however it will not work   out-of-the-box on a 573 fitted with a digital I/O board as the 4-pin CD audio   cable will not be plugged into the drive.

SPU audio streaming can replace XA and will work on both platforms.</li> <li>Have separate executables for PS1 and 573. Since the PS1 BIOS parses   <code>SYSTEM.CNF</code> while the 573 BIOS ignores it, a disc can have two different   executables, one named <code>PSX.EXE</code> (which will be launched on a 573) and the   other (which will run on a PS1) referenced by <code>SYSTEM.CNF</code>.

Additional copies of <code>PSX.EXE</code> with the file names   commonly used by BIOS mod boards (<code>QSY.DXD</code>, <code>TSV.AXG</code> and so on) shall also   be present.</li> <li>Do not rely on the RTC. Most 573 boards have a dead RTC battery by now.   As the battery is sealed inside the RTC it is basically impossible to replace   without replacing the entire chip, which is something not all 573 owners can   do. RTC RAM is additionally used by some games to store security-related data   and shall not be used for saving.</li> <li>Implement an operator/settings menu.

Konami's bitstreams use the 29.45 MHz   oscillator as the main clock, additionally dividing it down to 14.725 MHz and   feeding it to the MAS3507D's clock input.</li> <li>The 19.6608 MHz clock is left unused by most (all?) bitstream variants, but   was likely meant to be used for RS-232. Dividing it by 512, 1024, 2048 or 4096   will give the standard baud rates of 38400, 19200, 9600 and 4800 respectively.   The UART driving the RS-232 port may have been removed from the bitstream at   some point to make room for the other circuitry.</li> <li>Most input pins have external pullup resistors, so enabling the FPGA's   internal pullups is not necessary.</li> <li>Light outputs must be configured as open-drain in order to work properly. The   optocouplers' anodes are fed 5V rather than 3.3V; setting the outputs high   instead of putting them into high-z will result in a voltage difference of   ~1.7V across the optocouplers' LEDs, which is enough to trigger them.</li> <li>The \"5V tolerant I/O\" option in Xilinx's bitstream generator must be   enabled when building custom bitstreams. There are no level shifters between   the FPGA and the 573's system bus.</li> <li>The FPGA's <code>M0</code>, <code>M1</code> and <code>/PWRDWN</code> pins seem to be hardwired to 3.3V.</li> <li>The DAC's <code>CKS</code> pin is hardwired to ground, so the I2S master clock must   always be 256 * the sampling rate.</li> <li>Pin 119 is set up by the DDR bitstream as a logical AND of pins 61-64. It is   currently unclear if it goes to any other part on the board.</li> <li>Konami's bitstreams map the DRAM chips into a single address space as follows:</li> <li><code>0x0000000-0x07fffff</code>: 22H</li> <li><code>0x0800000-0x0ffffff</code>: 22J</li> <li><code>0x1000000-0x17fffff</code>: 22G</li> </ul>"},{"location":"konamisystem573/#security-cartridge-pinouts","title":"Security cartridge pinouts","text":""},{"location":"konamisystem573/#rs-232-network-connector","title":"RS-232 \"network\" connector","text":"<p>Present on <code>GX700-PWB(E)</code>, <code>GX896-PWB(A)A</code>, <code>GX883-PWB(D)</code> and <code>GE949-PWB(D)A</code> cartridges.

Neither the kernel nor the Sony libraries will try to make use of it, so it is therefore completely up for grabs to the programmer. A good example would be if you were to write a piece of code that's doing a lot of CRC computation, to use the 1KB scratchpad to initially load the CRC lookup tables, which incidentally, is exactly 1KB large. Doing this will speed up reads from the lookup table, while also keeping the whole CRC code in the i-Cache, hence being more optimal than  what you'd get with an automatic d-Cache system where parts of the table would be evicted while reading the data to compute the CRC of. Unlike an automatic d-Cache system however,  there is no row burst reads, so memory throughput is still much lower than if a d-Cache was present. Note that the scratchpad is NOT executable.

It is important to realize that the write queue's mechanism is only viable for normal memory attached to the main CPU, and that any hardware register state machine will get messed up by it. The typical example is the typical JEDEC standard to access flash, which usually does the following sequence to read the ID of a flash chip: <pre><code>    base[0xAAA] = 0xAA;\nbase[0x555] = 0x55;\nbase[0xAAA] = 0x90;\nuint8_t mnfctrID = base[0x000];\nuint8_t deviceId = base[0x002];\n</code></pre></p> <p>In this example above, if <code>base</code> is located in a memory segment that has the write queue enabled, even if the low level assembly code will do the first 3 stores before doing 2 loads, the physical signals sent to that device through the CPU bus will be seen in the sequence: <pre><code>store(0xaaa, 0xaa)\nload(0x000)\nstore(0x555, 0x55)\nload(0x002)\nstore(0xaaa, 0x90)\n</code></pre></p> <p>Therefore, using KSEG1 that disables the write queue is the only way to ensure that the operations are done in the proper way.</p> <p>The above is valid for most of the hardware connected to the main CPU, such as the CDROM controller, exp1, exp2, the SPU, or the GPU. Therefore, using BF80180xh to access the CDROM registers is more correct than using 1F80180xh.</p> <p>It is noteworthy that the Sony code will still incorrectly use KUSEG as the memory map for all hardware registers, and they then spend a lot of time writing 4 dummy values somewhere, in order to ensure the write queue has been flushed.</p> <p>The SN debugger in contrast is properly using the KSEG1 memory map for all the hardware registers, nullifying the need to flush the write queue when accessing it.</p> <p>It's also noteworthy that doing ANY KSEG1 access (read OR write) will automatically stall the CPU in order to flush the whole write queue before proceeding with the operation. Therefore, all BIOS ROM operations will naturally and effectively have the write queue disabled, as this code requires the CPU to read from KSEG1 constantly.</p> <p>This also means that if using KUSEG for the hardware registers, another method to flush the write queue, albeit potentially slightly less efficient, would be to simply read the first byte located at BFC00000h. The latter is what is effectively described as the official method to flush the write queue in the MIPS handbook.

Currently the only known chip name is an EPROM (MX 27C1000DC-90, with sticker \"Title=DTL-H2700, Ver=1.00, Date=96.12.4, Sum=046B No.\"). The ISA card is having markings: \"SONY HCD MWB-7? MADE IN JAPAN, PA47 1-589-003-01 1642E03A0\". One uncommon feature is an extra connector for a \"trigger switch\" (foot pedal), which is reportedly used for activating performance analyzer logging.</p>"},{"location":"psxdevboardchipsets/#sony-dtl-h201a-dt-hv-graphic-artist-board-ibm-pcats-to-ntsc-video","title":"Sony DTL-H201A / DT-HV - Graphic Artist Board (IBM PC/ATs to NTSC video)","text":"<pre><code>  X2     xpin TXC-2 OSC 66.000MHz\n  X1     xpin TXC-2AOSC 53.693MHz\n  U16   14pin 74F74 (dual flipflop)\n  U29   14pin 74AS04 (hex inverters)\n  U14   20pin LVT244 (dual 4-bit 3-state noninverting buffer/line driver)\n  U18   20pin LVT244 (dual 4-bit 3-state noninverting buffer/line driver)\n  U15   20pin ACT244 (dual 4-bit 3-state noninverting buffer/line driver)\n  U11   84pin Altera EPM7096LC84-12 (sticker: \"artpc13\" or \"ARTPC13\")\n  U13  160pin Sony CXD8514Q     ;GPU'a\n  U5    14pin ALS38A   ?

Except, 4000h..FFFFh could be used with pitch modulation (as they are multiplied by 0.00..1.99 before clipping; in practice this works only for 4000h..7FFFh; as values 8000h..FFFFh are mistaken as signed values).</p>"},{"location":"soundprocessingunitspu/#4-point-gaussian-interpolation","title":"4-Point Gaussian Interpolation","text":"<p>Interpolation is applied on the 4 most recent 16bit ADPCM samples (new,old,older,oldest), using bit4-11 of the pitch counter as 8bit interpolation index (i=00h..FFh): <pre><code>  out =       ((gauss[0FFh-i] * oldest) SAR 15)\n  out = out + ((gauss[1FFh-i] * older)  SAR 15)\n  out = out + ((gauss[100h+i] * old)    SAR 15)\n  out = out + ((gauss[000h+i] * new)    SAR 15)\n</code></pre> The Gauss table contains the following values (in hex): <pre><code>  -001h,-001h,-001h,-001h,-001h,-001h,-001h,-001h ;\\\n  -001h,-001h,-001h,-001h,-001h,-001h,-001h,-001h ;\n  0000h,0000h,0000h,0000h,0000h,0000h,0000h,0001h ;\n  0001h,0001h,0001h,0002h,0002h,0002h,0003h,0003h ;\n  0003h,0004h,0004h,0005h,0005h,0006h,0007h,0007h ;\n  0008h,0009h,0009h,000Ah,000Bh,000Ch,000Dh,000Eh ;\n  000Fh,0010h,0011h,0012h,0013h,0015h,0016h,0018h ; entry\n  0019h,001Bh,001Ch,001Eh,0020h,0021h,0023h,0025h ; 000h..07Fh\n  0027h,0029h,002Ch,002Eh,0030h,0033h,0035h,0038h ;\n  003Ah,003Dh,0040h,0043h,0046h,0049h,004Dh,0050h ;\n  0054h,0057h,005Bh,005Fh,0063h,0067h,006Bh,006Fh ;\n  0074h,0078h,007Dh,0082h,0087h,008Ch,0091h,0096h ;\n  009Ch,00A1h,00A7h,00ADh,00B3h,00BAh,00C0h,00C7h ;\n  00CDh,00D4h,00DBh,00E3h,00EAh,00F2h,00FAh,0101h ;\n  010Ah,0112h,011Bh,0123h,012Ch,0135h,013Fh,0148h ;\n  0152h,015Ch,0166h,0171h,017Bh,0186h,0191h,019Ch ;/\n  01A8h,01B4h,01C0h,01CCh,01D9h,01E5h,01F2h,0200h ;\\\n  020Dh,021Bh,0229h,0237h,0246h,0255h,0264h,0273h ;\n  0283h,0293h,02A3h,02B4h,02C4h,02D6h,02E7h,02F9h ;\n  030Bh,031Dh,0330h,0343h,0356h,036Ah,037Eh,0392h ;\n  03A7h,03BCh,03D1h,03E7h,03FCh,0413h,042Ah,0441h ;\n  0458h,0470h,0488h,04A0h,04B9h,04D2h,04ECh,0506h ;\n  0520h,053Bh,0556h,0572h,058Eh,05AAh,05C7h,05E4h ; entry\n  0601h,061Fh,063Eh,065Ch,067Ch,069Bh,06BBh,06DCh ; 080h..0FFh\n  06FDh,071Eh,0740h,0762h,0784h,07A7h,07CBh,07EFh ;\n  0813h,0838h,085Dh,0883h,08A9h,08D0h,08F7h,091Eh ;\n  0946h,096Fh,0998h,09C1h,09EBh,0A16h,0A40h,0A6Ch ;\n  0A98h,0AC4h,0AF1h,0B1Eh,0B4Ch,0B7Ah,0BA9h,0BD8h ;\n  0C07h,0C38h,0C68h,0C99h,0CCBh,0CFDh,0D30h,0D63h ;\n  0D97h,0DCBh,0E00h,0E35h,0E6Bh,0EA1h,0ED7h,0F0Fh ;\n  0F46h,0F7Fh,0FB7h,0FF1h,102Ah,1065h,109Fh,10DBh ;\n  1116h,1153h,118Fh,11CDh,120Bh,1249h,1288h,12C7h ;/\n  1307h,1347h,1388h,13C9h,140Bh,144Dh,1490h,14D4h ;\\\n  1517h,155Ch,15A0h,15E6h,162Ch,1672h,16B9h,1700h ;\n  1747h,1790h,17D8h,1821h,186Bh,18B5h,1900h,194Bh ;\n  1996h,19E2h,1A2Eh,1A7Bh,1AC8h,1B16h,1B64h,1BB3h ;\n  1C02h,1C51h,1CA1h,1CF1h,1D42h,1D93h,1DE5h,1E37h ;\n  1E89h,1EDCh,1F2Fh,1F82h,1FD6h,202Ah,207Fh,20D4h ;\n  2129h,217Fh,21D5h,222Ch,2282h,22DAh,2331h,2389h ; entry\n  23E1h,2439h,2492h,24EBh,2545h,259Eh,25F8h,2653h ; 100h..17Fh\n  26ADh,2708h,2763h,27BEh,281Ah,2876h,28D2h,292Eh ;\n  298Bh,29E7h,2A44h,2AA1h,2AFFh,2B5Ch,2BBAh,2C18h ;\n  2C76h,2CD4h,2D33h,2D91h,2DF0h,2E4Fh,2EAEh,2F0Dh ;\n  2F6Ch,2FCCh,302Bh,308Bh,30EAh,314Ah,31AAh,3209h ;\n  3269h,32C9h,3329h,3389h,33E9h,3449h,34A9h,3509h ;\n  3569h,35C9h,3629h,3689h,36E8h,3748h,37A8h,3807h ;\n  3867h,38C6h,3926h,3985h,39E4h,3A43h,3AA2h,3B00h ;\n  3B5Fh,3BBDh,3C1Bh,3C79h,3CD7h,3D35h,3D92h,3DEFh ;/\n  3E4Ch,3EA9h,3F05h,3F62h,3FBDh,4019h,4074h,40D0h ;\\\n  412Ah,4185h,41DFh,4239h,4292h,42EBh,4344h,439Ch ;\n  43F4h,444Ch,44A3h,44FAh,4550h,45A6h,45FCh,4651h ;\n  46A6h,46FAh,474Eh,47A1h,47F4h,4846h,4898h,48E9h ;\n  493Ah,498Ah,49D9h,4A29h,4A77h,4AC5h,4B13h,4B5Fh ;\n  4BACh,4BF7h,4C42h,4C8Dh,4CD7h,4D20h,4D68h,4DB0h ;\n  4DF7h,4E3Eh,4E84h,4EC9h,4F0Eh,4F52h,4F95h,4FD7h ; entry\n  5019h,505Ah,509Ah,50DAh,5118h,5156h,5194h,51D0h ; 180h..1FFh\n  520Ch,5247h,5281h,52BAh,52F3h,532Ah,5361h,5397h ;\n  53CCh,5401h,5434h,5467h,5499h,54CAh,54FAh,5529h ;\n  5558h,5585h,55B2h,55DEh,5609h,5632h,565Bh,5684h ;\n  56ABh,56D1h,56F6h,571Bh,573Eh,5761h,5782h,57A3h ;\n  57C3h,57E2h,57FFh,581Ch,5838h,5853h,586Dh,5886h ;\n  589Eh,58B5h,58CBh,58E0h,58F4h,5907h,5919h,592Ah ;\n  593Ah,5949h,5958h,5965h,5971h,597Ch,5986h,598Fh ;\n  5997h,599Eh,59A4h,59A9h,59ADh,59B0h,59B2h,59B3h ;/\n</code></pre> The PSX table is a bit different as the SNES table: Values up to 3569h are smaller as on SNES, the remaining values are bigger as on SNES, and the width of the PSX table entries is 4bit higher as on SNES.

As a workaround, one can increase the DMA blocksize to 11h words, and then the following is received: <pre><code>  1st block:   FFFFh, halfwords[00h..1Eh], twice halfword[1Fh]\n  2nd block:   FFFFh, halfwords[20h..3Eh], twice halfword[3Fh]\n  etc.\n</code></pre> this time, all data is received, but after the transfer one must still remove the FFFFh values, and the duplicated halfwords by software. Aside from the \\&lt;inserted&gt; FFFFh values there are occassionaly some unstable halfwords ORed by FFFFh (or ORed by other garbage values), this can be fixed by using \"rep2\" mode, which does then receive: <pre><code>  1st block:   FFFFh, halfwords[00h,00h,..0Eh,0Eh], triple halfword[0Fh]\n  2nd block:   FFFFh, halfwords[10h,10h,..1Eh,1Eh], triple halfword[1Fh]\n  etc.\n</code></pre> again, remove the first halfword (FFFFh) and the last halfword, and, take the duplicated halfwords ANDed together. Unstable values occur only every 32 halfwords or so (probably when the SPU is simultaneously reading ADPCM data), but do never occur on two continous halfwords, so, even if one halfword was ORed by garbage, the other halfword is always correct, and the result of the ANDed halfwords is 100% stable. Note: The unstable reading does NOT occur always, when resetting the PSX a couple of times it does occassionally boot-up with totally stable reading, since there is no known way to activate the stable \"mode\" via I/O ports, the stable/unstable behaviour does eventually depend on internal clock dividers/multipliers, and whether they are starting in sync with the CPU or not.
