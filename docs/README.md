## **IMPORTANT UPDATE**

On the 20th of August 2022, Martin surprisingly released a new version of this documentation. While this fork will try to incorporate the changes, one important footnote that got added is the following:

> I am homeless in [Hamburg](https://problemkaputt.de/homeless.htm), please help me out!

The authors of this fork thought that this deserves more than a footnote, hence this notice here.
