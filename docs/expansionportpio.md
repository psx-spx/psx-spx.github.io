#   Expansion Port (PIO)
Expansion Port can contain ROM, RAM, I/O Ports, etc. For ROM, the first 256
bytes would contain the expansion ROM header.<br/>

For region 1, the CPU outputs a chip select signal (CPU Pin 98, /EXP).<br/>
For region 2, the CPU doesn't produce a chip select signal (the region is
intended to contain multiple I/O ports, which require an address decoder
anyways, that address decoder could treat any /RD or /WR with A13=Hi and A23=Hi
and A22=Lo as access to expansion region 2 (for /WR, A22 may be ignored;
assuming that the BIOS is read-only).<br/>

#### Size/Bus-Width
The BIOS initalizes Expansion Region 1 to 512Kbyte with 8bit bus, and Region 2
to 128 bytes with 8bit bus. However, the size and data bus-width of these
regions can be changed, see:<br/>
[Memory Control](memorycontrol.md)<br/>
For Region 1, 32bit reads are supported even in 8bit mode (eg. 32bit opcode
fetches are automatically processed as four 8bit reads).<br/>
For Region 2, only 8bit access seems to be supported (except that probably
16bit mode allows 16bit access), anyways, larger accesses seem to cause
exceptions... not sure if that can be disabled...?<br/>

#### Expansion 1 - EXP1 - Intended to contain ROM
[EXP1 Expansion ROM Header](expansionportpio.md#exp1-expansion-rom-header)<br/>

#### Expansion 2 - EXP2 - Intended to contain I/O Ports
[EXP2 Dual Serial Port (for TTY Debug Terminal)](expansionportpio.md#exp2-dual-serial-port-for-tty-debug-terminal)<br/>
[EXP2 DTL-H2000 I/O Ports](expansionportpio.md#exp2-dtl-h2000-io-ports)<br/>
[EXP2 Post Registers](expansionportpio.md#exp2-post-registers)<br/>
[EXP2 Nocash Emulation Expansion](expansionportpio.md#exp2-nocash-emulation-expansion)<br/>

#### Expansion 3 - EXP3 - Intended to contain RAM
Not used by BIOS nor by any games. Seems to contain 1Mbyte RAM with 16bit
databus (ie. 512Kx16) in DTL-H2000.<br/>

#### Other Expansions
Aside from the above, the Expansion regions can be used for whatever purpose,
however, mind that the BIOS is reading from the ROM header region, and is
writing to the POST register (so 1F000000h-1F0000FFh and 1F802041h should be
used only if the hardware isn't disturbed by those accesses).<br/>
Most arcade boards have their custom I/O registers (and sometimes game ROMs)
mapped into the EXP1 and/or EXP2 regions.<br/>

#### Missing Expansion Port
The expansion port is installed only on older PSX boards, newer PSX boards and
all PSone boards don't have that port. However, the CPU should still output all
expansion signals, and there should be big soldering points on the board, so
it'd be easy to upgrade the console.<br/>

#### Latched Address Bus
Note that A0..A23 are latched outputs, so they can be used as general purpuse
24bit outputs, provided that the system bus isn't used for other purposes (such
like /BIOS, /SPU, /CD accesses) (A0..A23 are not affected by Main RAM and GPU
addressing, nor by internal I/O ports like Timer and IRQ registers).<br/>



##   EXP1 Expansion ROM Header
#### Expansion 1 - ROM Header (accessed with 8bit databus setting)
```
  Address  Size Content
  1F000000h 4   Post-Boot Entrypoint (eg. 1F000100h and up)
  1F000004h 2Ch Post-Boot ID ("Licensed by Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.")
  1F000030h 50h Post-Boot TTY Message (must contain at least one 00h byte)
  1F000080h 4   Pre-Boot Entrypoint  (eg. 1F000100h and up)
  1F000084h 2Ch Pre-Boot ID  ("Licensed by Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.")
  1F0000B0h 50h Not used     (should be zero, but may contain code/data/io)
  1F000100h ..  Code, Data, I/O Ports, etc.
```
The entrypoints are called if their corresonding ID strings are present, return
address to BIOS is passed in R31, so the expansion ROM may return control to
BIOS, if that should be desired.<br/>
Aside from verifying the IDs, the BIOS will also display the Post-Boot ID
string (and the following message string) via TTY (done right before calling
the Post-Boot Entrypoint).<br/>

#### Pre-Boot Function
The Pre-Boot function is called almost immediately after Reset, with only some
Memory Control registers initialized, the BIOS function vectors at A0h, B0h,
and C0h are NOT yet initialized, so the Pre-Boot function can't use them.<br/>

#### Post-Boot Function
The Post-Boot function gets called while showing the "PS" logo, but before
loading the .EXE file. The BIOS function vectors at A0h, B0h, and C0h are
already installed and can be used by the Post-Boot Function.<br/>
Note that the Post-Boot Function is called ONLY when the "PS" logo is shown
(ie. not if the CDROM drive is empty, or if it contains an Audio CD).<br/>

#### Mid-Boot Hook
One common trick to hook the Kernel after BIOS initialization, but before CDROM
loading is to use the Pre-Boot handler to set a COP0 opcode fetch hardware
breakpoint at 80030000h (after returning from the Pre-Boot handler, the Kernel
will initialize important things like A0h/B0h/C0h tables, and will then break
again when starting the GUI code at 80030000h) (this trick is used by Action
Replay v2.0 and up).<br/>

Expansion ROMs are most commonly used in cheat devices,<br/>

##   EXP2 Dual Serial Port (for TTY Debug Terminal)
#### SCN2681 Dual Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (DUART)
The PSX/PSone retail BIOS contains some TTY Debug Terminal code; using an
external SCN2681 chip which can be connected to the expansion port.<br/>
Whilst supported by all PSX/PSone retail BIOSes on software side, there aren't
any known PSX consoles/devboards/expansions actually containing DUARTs on
hardware side.<br/>

Bit7-5 are appended to the corresponding data character in the receive FIFO. A
read of the status provides these bits (7:5) from the top of the FIFO together
with bits (4:0). These bits are cleared by a "reset error status" command. In
character mode they are discarded when the corresponding data character is read
from the FIFO. In block error mode, block error conditions must be cleared by
using the error reset command (command 4x) or a receiver reset.<br/>

Unknown if the Interrupt signal is connected to the PSX... there seems to be no
spare IRQ for it, though it \<might\> share an IRQ with whatever other
hardware...?<br/>
The BIOS seems to use only one of the two channels; for the std\_io functions:<br/>
[BIOS TTY Console (std_io)](kernelbios.md#bios-tty-console-std_io)<br/>
Aside from the external DUART, the PSX additionally contains an internal UART,<br/>

#### 1F802030h - DTL-H2000: Secondary IRQ10 Controller (IRQ Flags)
This register does expand IRQ10 (Lightgun) to more than one IRQ source. The
register contains only Secondary IRQ Flags (there seem to be no Secondary IRQ
Enable bits; at least not for Lightguns).<br/>
```
  0     ... used for something
  1    Lightgun IRQ (write: 0=No change, 1=Acknowledge) (read: 0=None, 1=IRQ)
  2-3  Unknown/unused (write: 0=Normal)
  4     ... acknowledged at 1FA00B04h, otherwise unused
  5     ... TTY RX ?
  6-7  Unknown/unused (write: 0=Normal)
  8-31 Not used by DTL-H2000 BIOS (but Lightgun games write 0 to these bits)
```
Retail games that support IRQ10-based "Konami" Lightguns are containing code
for detecting and accessing port 1F802030h. The detection works by examining a
value in the BIOS ROM like so:<br/>
```
  IF [BFC00104h]=00002000h then Port 1F802030h does exist     (DTL-H2000)
  IF [BFC00104h]=00002500h then Port 1F802030h does NOT exist
  IF [BFC00104h]=00000003h then Port 1F802030h does NOT exist (default)
  IF [BFC00104h]= <other>  then Port 1F802030h does NOT exist
```
Normal consoles don't include Port 1F802030h, and IRQ10 is wired directly to
the controller port, and the value at [BFC00104h] is always 00000003h.
Accordingly, one cannot upgrade the console just by plugging a Secondary IRQ10
controller to the expansion port (instead, one would need to insert the
controller between the CPU and controller plug, and to install a BIOS with
[BFC00104h]=00002000h).<br/>
The DTL-H2000 BIOS accesses 1F802030h with 8bit load/store opcodes, however,
the Lightgun games use 32bit load/store - which is theoretically overlapping
port 1F802032h, though maybe the memory system does ignore the upper bits.<br/>

#### 1F802040h - DTL-H2000: EXP2: 1-byte - DIP Switch?
```
  0-7  DIP Value (00h..FFh, but should be usually 00h..02h)
```
This register selects the DTL-H2000 boot mode, for whatever reason it's called
"DIP Switch" register, although the DTL-H2000 boards don't seem to contain any
such DIP Switches (instead, it's probably configured via some I/O ports on PC
side). Possible values are:<br/>
```
  DIP=0 --> .. long delay before TTY?   with "PSX>" prompt, throws CDROM cmds
  DIP=1 --> .. long delay before TTY?   no "PSX>" prompt           PSY-Q?
  DIP=2 --> .. instant TTY?             with "PSX>" prompt
  DIP=3 --> Lockup
  DIP=04h..FFh --> Lockup with POST=04h..FFh
```

#### 1F802042h - DTL-H2000: EXP2: POST/LED (R/W)
[EXP2 Post Registers](expansionportpio.md#exp2-post-registers)<br/>



##   EXP2 Post Registers
#### 1F802041h - POST - External 7-segment Display (W)
```
  0-3  Current Boot Status (00h..0Fh)
  4-7  Not used by BIOS    (always set to 0)
```
During boot, the BIOS writes incrementing values to this register, allowing to
display the current boot status on an external 7 segment display (much the same
as Port 80h used in PC BIOSes).<br/>

#### 1F802042h - DTL-H2000: EXP2: POST/LED (R/W)
```
  0-7 Post/LED value
```
8bit wide, otherwise same as POST 1F802041h on retail consoles.<br/>

#### 1F802070h - POST2 - Unknown? (W) - PS2
Might be a configuration port, or it's another POST register (which is used
prior to writing the normal POST bytes to 1FA00000h).<br/>
The first write to 1F802070h is 32bit, all further writes seem to be 8bit.<br/>

#### 1FA00000h - POST3 - External 7-segment Display (W) - PS2
Similar to POST, but PS2 BIOS uses this address.<br/>

##   EXP2 Nocash Emulation Expansion
#### 1F802060h Emu-Expansion ID1 "E" (R)
#### 1F802061h Emu-Expansion ID2 "X" (R)
#### 1F802062h Emu-Expansion ID3 "P" (R)
#### 1F802063h Emu-Expansion Version (01h) (R)
Contains ID and Version.<br/>

#### 1F802064h Emu-Expansion Enable1 "O" (R/W)
#### 1F802065h Emu-Expansion Enable2 "N" (R/W)
Activates the Halt and Turbo Registers (when set to "ON").<br/>

#### 1F802066h Emu-Expansion Halt (R)
When enabled (see above), doing an 8bit read from this address stops the CPU
emulation unless/until an Interrupt occurs (when "CAUSE AND SR AND FF00h"
becomes nonzero). Can be used to reduce power consumption, and to make the
emulation faster.<br/>

#### 1F802067h Emu-Expansion Turbo Mode Flags (R/W)
When enabled (see above), writing to this register activates/deactivates
"turbo" mode, which is causing new data to arrive immediately after
acknowledging the previous interrupt.<br/>
```
  0   CDROM Turbo       (0=Normal, 1=Turbo)
  1   Memory Card Turbo (0=Normal, 1=Turbo)
  2   Controller Turbo  (0=Normal, 1=Turbo)
  3-7 Reserved (must be zero)
```

##   EXP2 PCSX-Redux Emulation Expansion
PCSX-Redux contains some specific hardware registers for the purpose of testing and debugging.
They are located past the 1F802080h address, which means that accessing them on the real
hardware will cause an exception, unless the [1F80101Ch register](https://psx-spx.consoledev.net/memorycontrol/#1f80101ch-expansion-2-delaysize-usually-00070777h-128-bytes-8bit-bus) has been set to
be at least twice its normal size.

#### 1F802080h 4 Redux-Expansion ID "PCSX" (R)
Identification string. Use this to query that your binary is running under PCSX-Redux.

#### 1F802080h 1 Redux-Expansion Console putchar (W)
Adds this character to the console output. This is an easier way to write to the console than using the BIOS.

This port is also available on Duckstation.

#### 1F802081h 1 Redux-Expansion Debug break (W)
Causes a debug breakpoint to be triggered. PCSX-Redux will pause and the user will be alerted of a software breakpoint.

#### 1F802082h 1 Redux-Expansion Exit code (W)
Sets the exit code for the program. When in test mode, PCSX-Redux will exit with this code.

#### 1F802084h 4 Redux-Expansion Notification message pointer (W)
Displays a pop-up message to the user with the specified string.

See [PCSX-Redux's documentation](https://pcsx-redux.consoledev.net/mips_api/) for more details and examples.
